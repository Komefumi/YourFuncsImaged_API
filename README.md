# Your Funcs Imaged API

This is the Go Revel API code for a project I'm making that simply takes a function provided by the user, to generate an image from it.

More will be added later.

You're free to use this project as you see fit!

UPDATE 3/1/21: There is slow progress on this project, will need to speed up soon.

UPDATE 4/1/21: Paradigm shifts in personal life. Will finish this project quickly.
